## Game Description

Players will build a 30 card deck. 

## Rules
1. Each player MUST draw a card at the beginning of their turn.
	- If a player has no cards left to draw, they lose the game.
2. Each players hand must not exceed 5 cards at ANY point in time.
	- If a player has 5 cards in hand at the time of their draw step, the drawn card goes straight to the graveyard, face up.
	- *Exception:* Some modifiers exist to remove the limit for a player, either per turn or for the game.
3. Mana totals cannot exceed 10 per color.
4. Cards can be revived from the graveyard by paying 1 of each R, G, B mana in addition to the original cost of the card.
	- This is a fixed rate, the same card can be revived multiple times, with the same +3 mana requirement.
	- This is true for all cards, regardless of the initial color of the card.
	- *Exception:* Some modifiers exist to reduce the colors required, allowing for 1 or 2 color decks to be built, instead of using all 3 colors.
